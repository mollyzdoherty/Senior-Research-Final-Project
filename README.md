# Development of a Survey to Measure Peopleâ€™s Artistic Preferences and Their Ability to Identify AI-generated Art 
## Objective
 The objective of this project is to create a survey that allows the participant to rate an artwork in several categories and judge whether they think an artwork was created by AI or not. The results of the survey will be a valuable resource to the art community and could help determine how AI-generated art is perceived and the possible implications it could have for artists in the future.

## Methodology
 This project will feature a survey that will include a combination of AI-generated and human-made images that will be sorted by theme/topic. An AI-generated and human-made image will be shown side-to-side, and survey participants will be asked to try to label both images. Afterwards, they will be asked to rate each image in categories such as beauty, effort, emotion, and worth.
