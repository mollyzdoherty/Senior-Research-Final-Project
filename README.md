# Human Perception of AI-Generated Art
## Objective
The objective of this study is to determine how humans perceive AI-generated art and if they can successfully identify it.

## Methodology
A survey will be conducted to measure people’s artistic preferences and their ability to identify AI-generated art. The survey will consist of 8 images of AI-generated art and 8 images of human-made art that will be paired based on the image’s topic or theme. Survey participants will be asked to label each image as “AI-generated” or “human-made” and then rate each artwork in four categories: beauty, emotion, effort, and worth, on a scale from 1-5. In the case of a participant believing they recognize an artwork or have previously seen it before, there will be an option to mark as so and the data for that response will be ignored. At the end of the survey, a question will be asked about the participant’s experience in art to see if those with more experience in art have differences in preferences or skill in identifying AI-generated art.  

The survey will be given to students in CSC 450 – Senior Research at Eastern Connecticut State University, and after the data is collected, identification accuracy will be calculated in Excel and the survey ratings will be analyzed by creating a script using R. The script will create graphs that will display the results of participants’ preferences in the four categories and accuracy for levels of artistic experience, as well as create a confusion matrix to show actual vs. predicted creators.
